Notty Games

Notty Games is a programming card game built with Python that challenges players to form valid card groups based on colors and numbers, following game-specific rules. This project was developed as part of a university programming module.


üéÆ Game Objective

Form the largest valid group of cards based on shared color or number, ensuring all cards are unique and adhere to the rules.


üõ†Ô∏è Features

Validates card groups using custom logic

Automatically finds valid or largest valid groupings

Simple and extendable Python structure


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. The file Notty runs the game

2. GameSetup sets up each screen

3. Button file has labels and buttons logic and visuals

4. CollectionofCards deals mainly with the game logic and the different game entities

5. All the different screen files focusses on displaying things on the screen

6. If you want to jump to the GameOver screen, I recommend using easy mode and passing the turn every round, the computer will end up picking all your cards. Doesn't work with medium or hard since it's designed not to pick the last card

Looking forward to discussing more about the game

We hope you have fun playing it!
