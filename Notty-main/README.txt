Dear Colin and Daniel,

This is our rendition of the card game Notty and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it. 

Just a few things that could help

1. The file Notty runs the game

2. GameSetup sets up each screen

3. Button file has labels and buttons logic and visuals

4. CollectionofCards deals mainly with the game logic and the different game entities

5. All the different screen files focusses on displaying things on the screen

6. If you want to jump to the GameOver screen, I recommend using easy mode and passing the turn every round, the computer will end up picking all your cards. Doesn't work with medium or hard since it's designed not to pick the last card

Looking forward to discussing more about the game

We hope you have fun playing it!
